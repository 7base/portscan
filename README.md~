Python Portscanner V0.2
===

About
---

My first Python Porject.<br>
Current version is more than basic...

How to use
---

1.- Download all and extract it into an empty directory.<br>
2.- Execute the main.py script with the python interpreter with the synthax "main.py x.x.x" where x.x.x is the IP range you want to scan (this is: 192.168.1 will scan your LAN for exemple)

Some information about the script
---

* Current version scans all IPs from x.x.x.1 to x.x.x.255<br>
* A file with a list of the results is saved in the same directory than the scripts.<br>
* The script creates temporary files in /tmp/, wich means that it only works on OS X and Linux Systems (windows   compatibility coming soon). The tmp-files should be deleted automaticly at the end of the script, if not, Unix will delete   them at the next boot.
