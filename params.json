The tmp-files should be deleted automaticly at the end of the script, if not, Unix will delete   them at the next boot.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n---\r\n\r\nMessage me via Jabber: 5tream@dukgo.com<br>\r\nDrop an eMail: admin@7base.net\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n---\r\n\r\n- V0.1 Initial upload\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
