Python Portscanner V0.1
========

My first Python Porject.<br>
Current version is more than basic...<br>
The script isn't finished yet and it isn't user-friendly at all, but I will improve this in the future.

How to use
=======

1.- Download all and extract it into an empty directory.<br>
2.- Execute the main.py script with the python interpreter.

Some information about the script
========

· Current version scans all IPs from x.x.x.1 to x.x.x.255<br>
· You can change the target in the ipscanner.py script on line 17<br>
· A file with a list of the results is saved in the same directory than the scripts.<br>
· Reports will be overwritten by executing the script twice, to prevent this, rename the resulting file for each scan.<br>
· The script creates temporary files in /tmp/, wich means that it only works on OS X and Linux Systems (windows   compatibility coming soon). The tmp-files should be deleted automaticly at the end of the script, if not, Unix will delete   them at the next boot.
